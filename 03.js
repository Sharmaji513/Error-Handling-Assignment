// 3. Car Description Class.

// Create a class called Car with three properties: company, model, and year. The class should have a method called getDescription that returns a string in the format "This is a <year> <company> <model>". Instantiate an instance of the Car class and call the getDescription method.

class Car{
    constructor(company,model,year){
        this.company = company;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
    getDescription(){
        return `This is a ${this.year} ${this.company} ${this.model}`
    }
}

const myCar = new Car ("BMW" ,"X5" , 2023 );

console.log(myCar.getDescription());
